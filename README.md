# Fridge-Project
A web-based project providing the user with several options of ingredients to pick from, provided with a search bar. selected ingredients will then be combined to pick recipes containing the entered ingredients from a database. Results are filtered based on the user's inputs and by quantity of ingredients available. The recipes are shown with pictures of them, they can also search for a specific recipe within their customized result page. Finally, by clicking on a recipe, more information such as cooking directions and calories are provided to help the user make better choices. 
## Objective
This is a college project with the objective of implementing a software-design pattern known as fa√ßade pattern. This design pattern serves as a front-facing interface masking more complex underlying code. To fulfill the purpose of this design, our team decided to create an easy-to-use UI for the user, which will be supported by some code in the backend, and that is the reason why we decided to create a webpage using html and CSS as front-end design with functionalities determined by a JavaScript code on the back-end. 
## Workload Repartition
Every member of the team is proud of the final work that was achieved at the end, to get there we divided the aspects of the project between us. Mainly there was the front-end, back-end, documentation, database, implementation of design pattern, PowerPoint, alongside many other aspects that were dismissed throughout the creation process.
## Limitations
Despite its usefulness, many aspects of the project could be improved for optimizing the user's experience, such as offering a larger variety of recipes, categorizing recipes as (breakfast, dessert...) and even letting users add some recipes to their favorites, and even offering suggestions based on their favorite recipes.
